              AgeWell was born from the realization that aging should not mean isolation.
              Our founders, with backgrounds in healthcare and technology, saw the struggles
              elders and caregivers face daily ‚Äî from managing medications, to emergency
              response delays, and disconnection from family. AgeWell bridges these gaps by
              offering intuitive tools to help elders live with dignity and autonomy, while
              keeping families and caregivers informed in real time.
